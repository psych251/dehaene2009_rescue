# PSYCH 251: Experimental Methods Rescue Project
## Replication of : "Why do children make mirror errors in reading? Neural correlates of mirror invariance in the visual word form area?"

This is a rescue project of Dehaene et al. (2009), study on mirror invariance vanishing in adults for reading. The original paper is titled: "Why do children make mirror errors in reading? Neural correlates of mirror invariance in the visual word form area?". This project had a replication report that was only able to partially replicate the results of the original study. The current project is an attempt to make modifications to the replication experiment design to be able to replicate results of the original study. 

This repository includes the experiment task launched in prolific for data collection, demographic and response data collected, final report and data analysis. 

This project was also part of the course, PSYCH 251: Experimental Methods, taught at Stanford University
